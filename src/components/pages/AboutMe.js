            Hello, my name is Myrla Flores. I am new to the web development
            world. I am currently enrolled in the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp
            through the University of Arizona.
          </h4>

          <h4 className="bold-500 mtb-30">
            I currently reside in Tucson, AZ. I have a Bachelorâ€™s of Science in
            Psychology from The University of Arizona. Most of my work
            experience has been in Case Management.
          </h4>

          <h4 className="bold-500 mtb-30">
            The Bootcamp has been a very challenging experience yet it has been very
            rewarding. I have always enjoyed creating things and working with computers. This
            is the reason why I decided Web Development is for me. I cannto wait to begin my journey in this field.
