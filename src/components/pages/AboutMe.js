            I reside in Tucson, AZ. I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s of Science in

            The Bootcamp was a very challenging experience yet it was very
            rewarding. I have always enjoyed creating things and technology.
            This is the reason why I decided Web Development is for me. I cannot
            wait to begin my journey in this field.
