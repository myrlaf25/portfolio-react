# Challenges
I am new to React. Actually, I am new to Web Development. I have learned a lot during the last few months and plan to continue learning to imrpove all my skills. I found it very challenging at being able to do the UI. Once, I was able to figure it out, things ran much more smooth. I do plan to continue adding or changing the UI. I think it will give me more experience and also to explore all the possibilities.
